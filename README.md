# CS50-Programming-with-python
Welcome to "CS50-Programming-with-python" repository. Part of my 6-week AI/ML Internship at Netsol, under the mentorship of Mr. Mohsin Alam. This repository documents my learning journey through Harvard's CS50 Python track, which lays the foundation for core programming skills essential for AI, backend development, and software engineering.
